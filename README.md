# sLushy Discord Bot

This repository will be the home of sLushy, a multi-purpose discord bot that can be used for simple tasks. 

Currently the source code is not public yet, as I am still working on major bug fixes with the bot, and I can not release a broken bot.  


## Roadmap

- Fix bot stability

- Continue doing code fixes for all commands

- Add more moderation commands

- Add database support for moderation

- Add new interactive commands that all users can use

- (POSSIBLE) Add leveling 

- (NOT LIKELY) Make a website dashboard


## What it will feature

- Large assortment of music commands
- Moderation with database support
- Interactive commands for all users
- Leveling?
